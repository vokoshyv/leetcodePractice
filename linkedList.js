  *                                                                                *
  *  Problem: Linked List                                                          *
  *                                                                                *
  *  Prompt: Create a Linked List class/constructor.                               *
  *          Name it LinkedList (js) or Linked_List(rb/py).                        *
  *                                                                                *
  *          Part 1: Create a node class for your LinkedList.                      *
  *                  Your node class will take an integer value and output         *
  *                  and output and object with the following properties:          *
  *                                                                                *
  *                  node.value: input value                                       *
  *                  node.next: a pointer to the next value (initiall null)        * 
  *                                                                                *
  *                  Example: { value: 1, next: null }                             *
  *                                                                                *
  *          Part 2: Create the LinkedList class.                                  *
  *                  It should contain the following properties:                   *
  *                                                                                *
  *                  head: pointer to the head node                                *
  *                  tail: pointer to the tail node                                *
  *                  length: number of nodes in the linked list                    *
  *                                                                                *
  *                  The LinkedList should also contain the following properties   *
  *                                                                                *
  *                  append: function that adds a node to the tail                 *
  *                                                                                *
  *                  insert: function that takes in two values, one to be inserted *
  *                          and one to search.  It searches the list for the      *
  *                          search value, and if found, adds a new node with the  *
  *                          insert value before the node with the search value.   *
  *                                                                                *
  *                  delete: function that removes a node at a specified location, *
  *                          with a default action of deleting the head            *
  *                                                                                *
  *                  contains: function that checks to see if a value is contained *
  *                            in the list                                         *
  *                                                                                *
  *  Input:  N/A                                                                   *
  *  Output: A LinkedList instance                                                 *
  *                                                                                *
  *  What are the time and auxilliary space complexities of the various methods?   *
  *                                                                                *
